📊 AWS Monitoring Support Lab
By Charles — Aspiring Cloud Engineer

🧠 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end AWS monitoring and alerting solution built using core AWS services: EC2, S3, CloudWatch, SNS, and IAM. It showcases automated metrics collection, real-time alarms, and notifications to maintain system health and availability.

Diagram Explanation:

EC2 instances generate logs and custom metrics.

CloudWatch collects metrics and triggers alarms based on thresholds.

Alarms notify via SNS to alert email recipients.

Logs are archived in an S3 bucket for compliance and analysis.

📦 Components Breakdown
Service	Role
EC2	Application host generating metrics and logs
CloudWatch	Monitoring metrics, creating alarms & dashboards
SNS	Sending notifications upon alarm triggers
S3	Centralized log storage
IAM	Securing access permissions

🚀 Features
Custom CloudWatch Alarms: CPU utilization, disk I/O, and network traffic thresholds monitored

SNS Notifications: Real-time email alerts on alarm triggers

Centralized Logs: Aggregated logs stored in S3 for retention and audit

IAM Roles: Fine-grained permissions for secure access management

Automated Setup: Includes scripts/configs for easy deployment and testing

🧪 How to Use
Launch EC2 instance(s) with monitoring agent installed

Configure CloudWatch agent to push metrics/logs to CloudWatch Logs

Deploy CloudWatch Alarms with predefined threshold configs

Subscribe your email to SNS topics for alerts

Monitor dashboard and react to notifications

🔐 Security Considerations
IAM roles with least privilege principle applied

S3 bucket access restricted via policies

Encrypted SNS communication

Alarms configured to minimize false positives
